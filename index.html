                <h2>What is Traffic Jams?</h2>
                <p>"Traffic jams," also known as traffic congestion or gridlock, occur when the volume of vehicles on a roadway exceeds its capacity, leading to a significant slowdown or halt in traffic flow. This often results in long queues of vehicles unable to move forward at a normal pace. Traffic jams can be caused by various factors such as accidents, road construction, bottlenecks, traffic signals, or simply an overwhelming volume of vehicles during peak travel times. They can have significant impacts on travel times, fuel consumption, air quality, and overall productivity in urban areas. Efforts to alleviate traffic jams typically involve infrastructure improvements, traffic management strategies, public transportation enhancements, and encouraging alternative modes of travel.</p>

                <h2>Impact Due to Traffics</h2>
                <p>Traffic congestion can have various impacts on individuals, communities, and the environment. Some of the notable impacts include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Time wastage:</b>Congestion leads to delays in travel time, causing frustration and stress among commuters.</li>
                    <li><b>Economic costs:</b>Businesses may suffer due to delays in delivery of goods and services, increased fuel consumption, and higher transportation costs.</li>
                    <li><b>Environmental effects:</b>Traffic congestion contributes to increased emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, worsening air quality and contributing to climate change. Idling vehicles emit pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which have harmful effects on human health and the environment.</li>
                    <li><b>Health impacts:</b>Prolonged exposure to traffic-related air pollution has been linked to various health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.</li>
